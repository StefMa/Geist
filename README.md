## How to build

#### What is needed
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install "build tools"
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to build and distribute
> Can be installed via `brew install yarn`
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to convert videos to gifs

#### Build
1. Check [What is needed](#what-is-needed)
2. Clone the repo
3. `yarn install`
4. `node_modules/.bin/electron .`
5. Smile! \o/

#### Build a release
To build a release just run
```
yarn run distribute
```
This will build a `.app`, `.zip` & `.dmg` file into the `dist/mac` directory.
Actually it builds for `mac x64`.

This will also remove the App from the recent window (tab switcher).

> **Note:** You can also build a single `.app` file with `yarn run pack`
